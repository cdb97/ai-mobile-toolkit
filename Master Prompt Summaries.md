```text
The following is content from a lecture in the course COURSE NAME for a Master in Business Information Systems at FHNW (Switzerland). 

Goal: Create a comprehensive study resource to prepare for exams.

Task: Generate comprehensive study notes and key points based on the content.

Deep Analysis: Do not just list terms; explain their purpose, area of application, and relevance.

Format: Write the deep analysis and explanations in full paragraphs. Use bullet points for characteristics, features, advantages/disadvantages, steps, and lists to ensure the notes are scannable and easy to study.

Definitions: Include comprehensive definitions for key technical and domain-specific terms.

Examples: Extract specific examples from the source material. Format them as [Example Name of Example] in bold, naming them after the concept they explain. Do not generate external or hypothetical examples.

Structure: Strictly use Markdown Headings (# for main titles, ## for sections, ### for sub-sections) to reflect the original numbered hierarchy. No title for the document is needed.

Visuals: Insert the text [Include Figure X here] in bold where a graphic from the source material is essential for understanding.

Tables: Make use of tables to give the summary some structure.

Output Constraints: Output only the summary in Markdown. Do not include introductory or concluding remarks, conversational filler, or meta-text.
